# Q4 :- Write a program to sum a list with 4 numbers.
list1=[34,56,78.9,22.5]
sum1=list1[0]+list1[1]+list1[2]+list1[3]
print(f"sum of the list {list1} is \n sum:- {sum}")

#                   OR

l = [22,5,78,12,55]
print(f"SUM of the list2 i.e {l}\n")
print(sum(l)) # if you have named a variable as sum then sum function will not work
# because python gets confused between the variuable sum and function sum()
