'''Q6:- Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.'''

# Taking input from the user and converting it to integer using int()
a= int(input("enter the number that has to be squared :- "))

# print("square of the number is :- ",a*a) # this will give square of a number

#               or

print("your squared or to the power number is :- ",a**2) 
#this will give not only square but any power of a number 
# even if you want to cube it you can write a**3 or a**4 for 4th power and so on
# a**b will give a to the power b
